            >Seven Samurai</a
          >
          at the
          <a href="https://www.eyefilm.nl/en"> Eye Filmmuseum </a>in Amsterdam.

          A village employs a rag-tag crew of hungry Samurai to defend them from
          a posse of marauding bandits. The bandits are repulsed, the crops are
          saved, and the samurai find love and stick around.
        </p>

        <p>A beautiful allegory for the origins of statehood. Some stills:</p>
