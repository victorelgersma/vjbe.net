# Personal site

How hard can it be to publish documents online? Apparently, quite hard. After trying unsuccessfully to get a markdown-based site off the ground, I was always unhappy with the styling glitches. This is therefore my attempt at an HTML-first blog site. All the articles are written in logic order in HTML.
